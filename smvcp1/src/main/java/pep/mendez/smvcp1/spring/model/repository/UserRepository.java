/**
 * 
 * Spring Data Repository
 * 
 * The goal of Spring Data repository abstraction is to significantly reduce the
 * amount of boilerplate code required to implement data access layers for
 * various persistence stores.
 * 
 * Defining this interface serves two purposes:
 * 
 * First, by extending JpaRepository we get a bunch of generic CRUD methods into
 * our type that allows us saving User, deleting them and so on.
 * 
 * Second, this will allow the Spring Data JPA repository infrastructure to scan
 * the classpath for this interface and create a Spring bean for it
 * automatically!!!
 * 
 * Spring will implement all JpaRepository interfaces at application start up
 * time.

	 * a cache. The cache isn't checked prior to method invocation, and the
	 * method is always invoked.
	 * 
	 * @CacheEvict: Indicates that Spring should evict one or more entries from
	 * a cache.
	 * 
	 * @Caching: A grouping annotation for applying multiples of the other
	 * caching annotations at once.
